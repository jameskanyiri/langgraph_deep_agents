LOAD_SKILLS_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
Load and manage reusable domain skills so the agent can use the right capabilities during planning and execution.

## What does a skill contain?
- Skills contains structured instruction, scripts, or resources that extends the agents base capabilities.

## When to use skills?
- Before, during, or after planning when the task likely needs domain expertise (e.g. brand writing, brand tone, specific document templates etc.)

## When to not use skills?
- When the task is not clear or not related to domain expertise or specific skills (e.g. "I need help with my project", "I need to write a report", etc.)

## Skill File Structure
- Each skill is a folder containing:
    - SKILL.md: Description, usage guidance and examples.
    
    
## Best Practices:
- Load only minimal required information per skill to stay efficient and focused.
- Compose compatible skills (e.g., research + brand_style); prune irrelevant ones

## Lifecycle:
- 1. Scan: Inspect available skills in the skills directory.
- 2. Match: Identify skills that are relevant to the current goal or user request.
- 3. Load: Retrieve and inject necessary context or scripts into the agentâ€™s workspace.

## Parameters:
- skill_name: The name of the skill to load (e.g., "brand_writing_skill", "research_guidelines_skill")

## Returns:
- The full content of the skill's SKILL.md file with instructions and examples.
