# Skill: Brand Writing

## Purpose
Ensure the final deliverable matches our brand’s tone, voice, and formatting.

## When to Use
- Any time the agent is drafting outward-facing text (reports, memos, slide notes, summaries).

## Style & Tone
- Voice: confident, friendly, clear.
- Sentences: short and active voice; avoid hedging unless uncertainty is material.
- Jargon: avoid; if required, define briefly.
- Inclusivity: respectful, people-first language.

## Formatting
- Headings: Title Case; body in sentence case.
- Lists: use "-" bullets; keep items parallel in structure.
- Numbers/dates: digits for numerals; dates as YYYY-MM-DD (update if your brand differs).

## Word Choices
- Prefer: “AI systems”, “evaluation”, “model performance”.
- Avoid: “bots”, “smart machines”.

## Structure
- Start with an Executive Summary (3–5 sentences).
- Use clear section headers; end with “Recommendations / Next Steps”.

## Do / Don’t
- **Do** cite concrete examples and numbers when possible.
- **Do** keep paragraphs ≤ 5 sentences.
- **Don’t** overclaim or speculate without evidence.

## Keywords (for matching)
brand, style, tone, writing, voice, formatting
