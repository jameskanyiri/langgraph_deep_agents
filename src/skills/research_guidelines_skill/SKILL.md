# Skill: Research Guidelines

## Purpose
Make research disciplined and credible before any drafting.

## When to Use
- Tasks involving research, literature review, market/competitive analysis, or when the user requests “sources” or “references”.

## Evidence & Sources
- Prefer authoritative sources (peer-reviewed papers, official stats, reputable orgs).
- Recency: if topic is fast-moving (policy, pricing, AI, security), aim for ≤ 12 months; otherwise justify older sources.
- Target: ≥ 3 credible sources overall; triangulate critical claims with ≥ 2.

## Claims & Citations
- Every non-trivial claim maps to at least one source.
- Use inline citations like (Author, Year) and include a link in a bibliography block.

## Planning (before writing)
1) Clarify scope (topic, audience, deliverable).
2) Draft 3–7 research questions.
3) Outline sections and note expected evidence per section.
4) List search keywords and where you’ll look.

## Quality Gates (block writing if unmet)
- Scope stated.
- At least one authoritative source per key question.
- Claims in outline have an evidence placeholder or source candidate.

## Keywords (for matching)
research, sources, citations, evidence, literature review
